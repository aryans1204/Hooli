## Steps to run the dev environment locally:

- from the root directory, head over to `cd backend`
- Run `npm install` and this will create a `node_modules` directory in the backend directory, which contains all the required packages to run the backend.

- RUn `mkdir config` and place the `dev.env` file under there to be able to upload secrets to the dev backend
